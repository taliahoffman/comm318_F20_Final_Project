## Presentation of your data story for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

The culmination of my data story project is a website. This website should read as a story directed at someone trying to learn more about the environment of healthy food accounts on Instagram and what makes certain accounts successful. The home page shows an overview of data and then I have four tabs that go into depth on Google Trends, the 29 popular Accounts, what makes an account successful, and the limitations of my research.
