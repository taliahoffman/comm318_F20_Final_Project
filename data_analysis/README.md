## Data analysis notebooks for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

I have included the name of my data_analysis notebooks below and a brief descroption of each notebook. For logic and coherence you should read the analysis notebooks in the order I have listed.

## Analysis notebooks:
 - `GoogleTrends_Data`: This notebook looks at interest in the search terms "Healthy Baking" and "Healthy Recipes" with two timeframe: 2015-2020 and 2020. The goal of this notebook is to determine if there has been a peak in healthy recipe popularity since COVID-19. 

 - `COVID-19_Data`: This notebook adds an element of data: reported COVID-19 cases in the US. Correlating search trends and positive test cases allows us to see if there is any relationship between these two variables
 
 - `All_Accounts`: Once I determined the relationship between COVID-19 and recipe searches was not strong enough, I pivoted towards Instagram. This notebook looks at 29 popular healthy Instagram accounts. The goal is to see how their engagement has been growing over the years. In this notebook you will become familiar with the average number of likes, posts, and comments across all users. 

 - `Accounts_by_Category`: This notebook takes all 29 accounts and categorizes them by any dietary specifications. The goal of this is to see if certain diets are more popular amongst Instagram followers. 
 
 - `Popular_Accounts`: This notebook ranks the previous 29 accounts by like and comment data. Then it takes the top 10 accounts and analyzes like and comment count more in depth. In this notebook you will learn the best day of the week to recieve posts or comments. 
 
  - `Individual_Posts`: Finally, we will look at the top 10 accounts at the individual level of posts. This notebook focuses on the type of content that each user posts and how that translates into likes and comments. 
  
Unfortunately, a lot of my data was not very insightful. However, I did my best to make sense of it and communicate a story using what I could.
