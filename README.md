## My Final Project for COMM318 _Stories from Data_ (Fall2020)

This quarantine my family spent a lot of time baking and cooking healthy recipes. Food was a savior during the long, idle days of lockdown– cooking and eating became the most popular activities in my household. However, as all of our stomachs expanded, we realized the importance of trying to maintain a healthy diet. For months we were cooped up in our house making almound flour blondies, vegan lemon poppy muffins, and cauliflower rice stir-fry. It was a great time to bond and experiment with new healthy recipes, and everyone in my family took this new vigor for healthy cooking with them as we finally parted for the year. 

I have always been a food enthusiast and love following healthy "influencers" on Instagram. To me, it appeared that their accounts were more popular than ever during quarantine. As a result, I made the following assumption– my family was one of many that turned to healthy cooking and baking this past year. So I started this project in an attempt to answer the following questons: did COVID-19 cases affect the amount of people seeking healthy cooking and baking recipes to make at home? Did user engagement with these healthy food blogs increase? I wanted to understand how healthy food accounts were growing and how they might evolve in the future. 

To answer my initial question I looked at NYT COVID-19 Case Data (https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html_) and Google Trends for the Terms "Healthy Baking Recipe" (https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=healthy%20baking%20recipe&geo=US)  and "Healthy Cooking Recipe" (https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=healthy%20cooking%20recipe). While I really enjoyed working with Google Trends and found it interesting to look at search interest over time, I did not see a meaningful way forward with this question. Ultimately, there was no real correlation between COVID-19 and healthy recipes. You can view all the data I collected in my data_analysis folder. When I realized this question was not as exciting as I thought and there would be insufficient data for analysis I pivoted to address a new question, what makes a successful healthy food blogger? 

## What makes a healthy food blogger?

To answer this question I needed to look at successful Instagram Accounts. As a result, I chose 29 popular healthy food accounts based on data from Upfluence– a software program designed to identify (https://www.upfluence.com/influencer-marketing/15-healthy-food-instagram-accounts-to-follow-in-2020). Then I used a website PhantomBuster (https://phantombuster.com/)– a data extraction service– to scrape all 29 accounts for every Instagram post. To answer my question I analyzed the following data:

For all 29 accounts– 
 - Total number of posts over time 
 - Total numeber of likes over time 
 - Total number of comments over time
 - The breakdown of accounts by dietary restriction 
Then, I narrowed my analysis down to the top 10 accounts to try and understand what makes them so successful. Here I looked at: 
 - The type of content they post 
 - Like data based on day of the week 
 - Comment data based on day of the week
 
To answer some of these question, I had to do a lot of data collection on my own in Excel. For example, I collected data on the diet each accounts prescribes to, the profession of each blogger, and the like/comment/content data for 300 individual posts. 

The data analysis notebooks provides all of my commentary and insights on the data I have gathered. Unfortunately– as with many data science project– I could not make any concrete conclusions with my data. However, this project helped me understand that not all data leads you where you want. As a result, you must continue to be creative and find new ways to sort, interpret and collect data. 

My final data story is presented in the form of a "how to" website. I used weebly.com to create my website. The goal of this website is to be fun, clear, and user friendly platform for anyone hoping to start a health food blog. Using the data I have collected, I offer insights and advice. Unfortunatelly, not all my data analsys made the cut for the final story– as some the content in the data_analysis folder is irrelevant to the final story. 

I hope you enjoy!
